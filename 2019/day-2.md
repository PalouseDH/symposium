# Collections as Data: Web and APIs

> Tuesday, May 14th, 9:00am - 4:00pm, CDIL.

## Objectives

- Critical understanding of collections as data.
- Understand the concept of web APIs.
- Literacy with digital files, data, and metadata.
- Critical web literacy: `viewsource`, markup languages, and Markdown.

# Outline:

## Morning

- Overview of "collections as data"
    - e.g. [Chronicling America](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/), [Chronam API](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/), add `&format=json`
    - e.g. [Aladore](https://archive.org/details/aladorehen00newbrich) on Archive.org (vs. old [archive version](https://web.archive.org/web/20150201010320/https://archive.org/details/aladorehen00newbrich))
    - [documents as data](http://history-lab.org/images/new-paper-stack.png) (from [History Lab](http://history-lab.org/)), using the lens of "data" to rethink traditional humanities research
    - "Collections as data" are "readily open to computation", [The Santa Barbara Statement on Collections as Data](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/statement/)
    - Philosophy for: research questions; collection planning; platform design
    - [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh)
- [Refine APIs!](https://evanwill.github.io/refine-apis/)
- *Remember to take Breaks...*

## Afternoon

HTML basics: [Mini- Web Crash Course](https://evanwill.github.io/mini-web-crash-course/)

- Introduce GitHub
- Critical web literacy: `viewsource`, markup languages, and Markdown.

## DH Discussion Session

Please look for a DH project that interests you, then:

- see if you can find background information about the project such as the data, people, tools, and outputs.
- share with the project with the group, using [Issue #12](https://github.com/PalouseDH/symposium/issues/12)
- we will discuss and deconstruct together

#### How Did They Make That? 

- DH projects deconstructions: explore source data, people, tools, outputs.
    - Miriam Posner, [How did they make that?](http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that/) 
    - Example: DH Commons series [How did they make that? Programming Historian](https://web.archive.org/web/20180713014622/http://dhcommons.org/journal/issue-1/editorial-sustainability-and-open-peer-review-programming-historian).
    - Sustainability? (how many dead projects have you seen?)
