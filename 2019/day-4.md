## DH Discussion Session

**Readings**

- Matt Jockers, [The LDA Buffet is Now Open; or, Latent Dirichlet Allocation for English Majors](http://www.matthewjockers.net/2011/09/29/the-lda-buffet-is-now-open-or-latent-dirichlet-allocation-for-english-majors/) (Topic Modeling "Fable")

- Ted Underwood and Jordan Sellers, ["How Quickly Do Literary Standards Change?"](https://figshare.com/articles/How_Quickly_Do_Literary_Standards_Change_/1418394). 
    - article explicitly explains the research process, from collecting/selecting data to analysis. Published as a draft with more content, questions, and illustrations than are allowed in a traditional article. Also published traditionally as, Jordan Sellers and Ted Underwood, "The Longue Durée of Literary Prestige", MLQ 77:3 (2016). Additionally, a GitHub repository shares the code necessary to reproduce the analysis, [paceofchange](https://github.com/tedunderwood/paceofchange) (2015).
- Extra: [Cultural Analytics Now](http://post45.research.yale.edu/sections/contemporaries/cultural-analytics-now/), ed. Dan Sinykin, *post45* (2019).
