## DH Discussion Session

**Readings**

- Matt Jockers's Topic Modeling "Fable" ([LDA Buffet](http://www.matthewjockers.net/2011/09/29/the-lda-buffet-is-now-open-or-latent-dirichlet-allocation-for-english-majors/))
- Ted Underwood, ["Seven Ways Humanists are Using Computers to Understand Text"](https://tedunderwood.com/2015/06/04/seven-ways-humanists-are-using-computers-to-understand-text/) (2015). (intro overview of types of computational analysis)
- Ted Underwood and Jordan Sellers, ["How Quickly Do Literary Standards Change?"](https://figshare.com/articles/How_Quickly_Do_Literary_Standards_Change_/1418394). 
    - article explicitly explains the research process, from collecting/selecting data to analysis. Published as a draft with more content, questions, and illustrations than are allowed in a traditional article. Also published traditionally as, Jordan Sellers and Ted Underwood, "The Longue DurÃ©e of Literary Prestige", MLQ 77:3 (2016). Additionally, a GitHub repository shares the code necessary to reproduce the analysis, [paceofchange](https://github.com/tedunderwood/paceofchange) (2015).
