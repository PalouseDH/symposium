## Articles:

* Binder, Jeffrey M. (2016). [Alien Reading: Text Mining, Language Standardization, and the Humanities](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/69). In M. Gold & L. Klein (Eds.), *Debates in the Digital Humanities*.
  *   An essay which gives a “brief account of the origins of a popular technique for topic modeling, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and attempt[s] to situate text mining in a broader history of thinking about language as a way of gesturing toward a fuller understanding of the cultural context surrounding text-mining methods.” The author identifies a “congruity between text mining and the language standardization efforts that began in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,” and also argues that “when applied to the study of literary and cultural texts, statistical text-mining methods tend to reinforce conceptions of language and meaning that are, at best, overly dependent on the “literal” definitions of words and, at worst, complicit in the marginalization of nonstandard linguistic conventions and modes of expression.”
  
* Christen, Kimberly. (2012). [Does Information Really Want to be Free? Indigenous Knowledge Systems and the Question of Openness](https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1618). *International Journal Of Communication, 6(24)*.
  *  An article discussing both the “histories of collecting and the politics of information circulation in relation to indigenous knowledge by looking closely at the history of the meme [“information wants to be free”] and its cultural and legal underpinnings.”
 
* Christen, Kimberly. (2015) ["On Not Looking: Economies of Visuality in Digital Museums,"](http://www.kimchristen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Christen_On_not_looking_205.pdf) in the International Handbooks of Museum Studies. In A. Coombes & R. B. Phillips.  (Eds.), *The International Handbooks of Museum Studies: Museum Transformations* (pp. 365-386).
  *  This work calls attention to the act of looking itself, with the aim of “undoing the notion of looking as a benign, natural, reflexive act and redirect our attention to understanding looking as a social and ethical stance deeply embedded in cultural assumptions and political structures.” The author “examines the digital museum landscape by exploring museum practices including virtual exhibitions, online databases, and web portals, focusing on projects that compel us to think differently about practices of looking and the production of knowledge, access, and authority.” 
  
* Christen, Kimberly. (2018) [Relationships not Records: Digital Heritage and the Ethics of Sharing Indigenous Knowledge Online.](http://www.kimchristen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/41christenKimberly.pdf) In J. Sayers  (Eds.), *Routledge Companion to Media Studies and Digital Humanities* (pp. 403-412). 
  *  An essay discussing the trends in archival work that are becoming normalized as “best practices for handling Indigenous materials in all types of repositories and collecting institutions.” It examines how “new Digital curation practices are "planned, defined, and put into action, as well as what they signal in terms of our academic and ethical values.”

* Cooper, David, & Gregory, Ian. (2011). [Mapping the English Lake District: A Literary GIS.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23020843) *Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers 36(1)*, 89-108.
  *  An article which looks at the ability of GIS to map the spatial relationships of qualitative data. It focuses on a case study that uses the spatial relationships outlined in two literary works which describe tours of the English Lake district in 1769 and 1802. 
  
* Folsom, Ed. (2007). [Database as Genre: The Epic Transformation of Archives.](http://digitalrhetoricandnetworkedcomposition.web.unc.edu/files/2016/01/folsom-database-as-genre.pdf) *PMLA 122(5)*, 1571-1579.
  *  A discussion of the idea of using databases as a genre. It examines the Walt Whitman Archives, a project co-edited by the author, which is an online database of Whitman’s works. The database is constructed in a format the author believes is particularly suited to the “rhizomic” nature of Whitman.

* Gallon, Kim. (2016). [Making the Case for the Black Digital Humanities.](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/55) In M. Gold & L. Klein (Eds.), *Debates in the Digital Humanities*.
  *  An essay discussing the “relationship between the digital humanities and Africana/African American/Black studies so as to highlight how technology can further expose humanity as a racialized social construction.”

* Gil, Alex. (2015, May 21). [The User, The Learner and the Machines We Make.](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2015/05/21/user-vs-learner/)
  *  An overview of minimalist computing centered on the question “what do we really need?”
  
* Karpathy, Andrej. (2017, November 11). [Software 2.0.](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35) *Medium*.
  *  An overview of neural networks in which the author argues that are the beginning of a “fundamental shift in how software is written.”

* Klein, Lauren F. (2013). [The Image of Absence: Archival Silence, Data Visualization, and James Hemings.](https://read.dukeupress.edu/american-literature/article/85/4/661-688/4953) *American Literature 85(4)*, 661-688.
  *  This essay looks at how computational linguistics and data visualization can be used to  “animate the mysteries of the past” as a means of countering the “silences endemic to the archive of American slavery”. This work also discusses the difficulties associated with viewing the archive of slavery via a DH lens. The author compares visualizations of the archival trace of James Hemings (Thomas Jefferson’s enslaved chef) with Jefferson’s own charts and tables to demonstrate how we must rethink “the empiricist epistemology of the visible that endures to this day.” 

* Lewis-Kraus, Gideon. (2016, December 14.) [The Great A.I. Awakening.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/magazine/the-great-ai-awakening.html) *The New York Times*. 
  *  An article describing Google Translate’s rapid improvement following the incorporation of machine learning.
  
 * McPherson, Tara. (2012). [Why Are the Digital Humanities So White? or Thinking the Histories of Race and Computation.](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/29) In M. Gold & L. Klein (Eds.), *Debates in the Digital Humanities*.
   *  An essay outlining the the need to close the gap between topics of race, immigration, and neoliberalism with data tools and infrastructure. The author outlines how the difficulty in doing so is due to the inherent nature of technological systems designed in the post-WWII computational culture.
   
* Moretti, Franco. (2000). [The Slaughterhouse of Literature.](https://msu.edu/course/eng/487/snapshot.afs/johnsen/61.1moretti.pdf) *MLQ: Modern Language Quarterly 61(1)*, 207-227.
  *  A book chapter which examines the idea that the historical literary canon represents a tiny fraction of the literary works of a given period (and the forgotten or unread books are therefore “slaughtered”). The author focuses on what he calls “rivals: contemporaries who write more or less like canonical authors (in my case, more or less like Arthur Conan Doyle), but not quite.” From this work the author hopes to “come up with a new sense of the literary field as a whole.”  
  
* Moretti, Franco. (2003). [Graphs, Maps, Trees.](https://www.mat.ucsb.edu/~g.legrady/academic/courses/09w259/Moretti_graphs.pdf) *New Left Review 24*, 67-93.
  *  Three interrelated articles which together discuss the changes that have occured in the study of literature using models “drawn from three disciplines—quantitative history, geography and evolutionary theory: graphs, maps and trees.”
  
* Posner, Miriam. (2014, March 18). [Commit to DH People, Not DH Projects](http://miriamposner.com/blog/commit-to-dh-people-not-dh-projects/) [blog post].
  *  A proposal for switching from calls for DH projects to providing funding for fellowship programs. Potential benefits and sample programs are presented.
  
* Posner, Miriam. (2016). [What’s Next: The Radical, Unrealized Potential of Digital Humanities.](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/54) In M. Gold & L. Klein (Eds.), *Debates in the Digital Humanities*.
  *  This work argues that the calls for the Digital Humanities to better integrate race and gender into the discipline are not enough, and that the DH community must “dismantle and rebuild” the very framework that underlies the logic of the discipline. She discusses how the basis on which DH research is conducted is inherently based on western principles. Examples include how Google Maps relies on Cartesian geography.

* Ramsay, Stephen. (2010). [The Hermeneutics of Screwing Around; or What You Do with a Million Books.](https://libraries.uh.edu/wp-content/uploads/Ramsay-The-Hermeneutics-of-Screwing-Around.pdf)
  *  An essay discussing the issues that stem from the amount of knowledge available to humankind. He concludes that “the ethical obligation of those in the digital humanities is neither to read them all  the books, nor to pretend that you have read them all, but to understand each path through the vast archive as an important moment in the world’s duration—as an invitation to community, relationship, and play.”

* Risam, Roopika. (2016). [Navigating the Global Digital Humanities: Insights from Black Feminism.](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/80) In M. Gold & L. Klein (Eds.), *Debates in the Digital Humanities*.
  *  An essay discussing the “question of how to navigate a scholarly community that is diverse in geography, language, and participant demographics.” The author clarifies the stakes of theorizing the local-global dimension of digital humanities by looking at “black feminist epistemology and its emphasis on intersectionality as a model for mediating between the universal and the particular and for attending to the tensions between local and global in the digital humanities.” The author also discusses the “challenges of maintaining the threads that cohere the field on a global scale as well as the local specificities that enrich its practices.”
  
* Sayers, Jentery. (2018). [Locating Praxis in Digital Studies: Designing Courses for Graduate Students.](https://jentery.github.io/uw/)
  *  An outline of “what humanities graduate students need in terms of digital knowledge for the future” and a discussion of what a “three-course, cross-disciplinary sequence in the foundations of digital humanities (DH) might look like.”
  
* Stanford Literary Lab [Pamphlets.](https://litlab.stanford.edu/pamphlets/)
  *  An ongoing series of publications relating to "computational criticism."

* Underwood, Ted. (2015, June 4). [Seven Ways Humanists are Using Computers to Understand Text](https://tedunderwood.com/2015/06/04/seven-ways-humanists-are-using-computers-to-understand-text/) [blog post]. 
  *  A blog post that provides an introductory overview of the types of computational analysis.
  
* Underwood, Ted, & Sellers, Jordan. (2015, June 19). [How Quickly Do Literary Standards Change?](https://figshare.com/articles/How_Quickly_Do_Literary_Standards_Change_/1418394) [blog post].
  *  An article which aims to explain how “literary significance itself was created and transformed” using data drawn from samples of poetry and fiction across the century 1820-1919. [Supporting Data](https://github.com/tedunderwood/paceofchange) for the article is available at the link.
  
* Underwood, Ted, Bamman, David, & Lee, Sabrina. (2018). [The Transformation of Gender in English-Language Fiction.](http://culturalanalytics.org/2018/02/the-transformation-of-gender-in-english-language-fiction/) *Journal of Cultural Analytics*. 
  *  Article exploring the “changing significance of gender in fiction, asking especially whether its prominence in characterization has varied from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the 21st.” [Supporting data set](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ZM2MAN) is available for replication.

* Burdick, A., Drucker, J., Lunenfeld, P., Presner, T., & Schnapp, J. (2012). [*Digital_Humanities.*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/digitalhumanities) Massachusetts: MIT Press. 
  *  This book is a “compact work composed by a group of practitioners from a variety of humanities disciplines and fields, including design.” Those authors do not “privilege one lineage or another within the Digital Humanities, seeking instead an encompassing yet polemical voice that speaks both inside and outside the walls of the academy. Accordingly, our case studies are fictional, our quotations of specific figures and theorists sparing, and our language direct.” Download a pdf copy via the link at the bottom left of the page.
  
* Graham, S., Milligan, I., & Weingart, S. (2015). [*Exploring Big Historical Data: The Historian's Macroscope.*](http://www.themacroscope.org/2.0/) London: Imperial College Press.

  *  A collection of articles discussing the use of technology in teaching and studying history. It “seeks to provide a consideration of the ways in which technology can and cannot help us interact with the content and practices of the discipline.” Part 1 discusses the “content and practices of the discipline, and show that playful technologies can help students better understand the way historians and storytellers create history.” Part 2 focuses on “the roots of our craft, and show that a ludic sensibility lies at the heart of how we research, how we teach, and how we express ideas with computers.” Part 3 discusses “how communicating ideas with computers forces us to model our thoughts, and the development and use of these models can provide us with new insights into the subjects they represent.” Part 4 demonstrates that “ through the act of creating technologies, we can build our understanding of the past.”

* Kelly, Mills T. (2013) [*Teaching History in the Digital Age.*](https://www.fulcrum.org/concern/monographs/8w32r647k) Michigan: University of Michigan Press.
  *  “The goal of this book is to challenge historians, but also others teaching in the humanities and social sciences, to think carefully about the ways that digital media are changing teaching and learning in our fields in the face of changes such as those mentioned earlier. At its most challenging, this book considers how the remix culture developing around and through new media is making it possible for our students (and us) to produce either new knowledge about the past, or old knowledge presented in new ways.”
