Zackary Turpin,Faculty,Lost Literature Laboratory,"Turpin's project broadly addresses the discovery of lost works of literature from the 19th century, using a variety of means, including (1) using digital methods to track a rare all-women's edition of the 1901 'Charleston Post & Courier,' one that dovetails strongly with today's #MeToo movement; and (2), using statistical analysis and Zipf's law to develop a checklist of 19thC American authors' most idiosyncratic keyword-identifiers (e.g., Melville's oddly frequent recourse to words like 'peep,' 'calabash,' 'terraqueous,' 'isolato,' and en passant') as a way to potentially pinpoint their unknown or lost works.",University of Idaho,"Assistant Professor, English Department",turpin.jpg

Andrew Gillreath-Brown,Graduate,WSU Historic Preservation Committee,"Andrew Gillreath-Brown is a PhD student <a target='_blank' href='https://andrewgillreathbrown.wordpress.com/'>(https://andrewgillreathbrown.wordpress.com/)</a> in the Department of Anthropology. As a computational archaeologist, his dissertation focuses on reconstructing past climates and how prehistoric people responded to environmental change. Further, he is concerned with how real people remembered past climate events, like drought, which can be gleaned from written accounts and ethnographies. He is very interested in the local history of Pullman and WSU and how people have viewed the city and campus in the past. His project at the CDSC focuses on digitally preserving and archiving historical information about WSU by creating an interactive Mukurtu (<a target='_blank' href='http://mukurtu.org/'>http://mukurtu.org/</a>) website, which will have a variety of information, such as historic images and people’s stories about buildings and places—enabling a diversity of voices to be expressed on local history. This will be a new digital teaching tool and will serve as a model for historic preservation committees that would like to build a website.",Washington State University,"Ph.D. Candidate, Anthropology",gillreath-brown.jpg
